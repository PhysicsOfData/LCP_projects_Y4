    "# Tracking muons with 4 Drift Tubes chambers setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The project consist in the analysis of the data gathered by four drift-tubes detectors during a beam test aimed at the production of $\\mu^+ - \\mu^-$ pairs. This was achieved by shooting 45 GeV positrons on a Beryllium target. Most of the collisons yielded background events (e.g. Bhabha scattering events), whereas only a small fraction produced an actual muons pair. A signal event would consist of two tracks, each traversing two muon detectors (as a dipole magnet deflected in different directions the positively and the negatively charged particles).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure displays a signal event. It is possible to notice the positioning of the four drift-tubes detectors. Particles are moving essentially along the $z$ axis (the beam direction) while the bending due to the dipole magnet occures along the $x$ axis. The $y$ coordinate is irrelevant in this context as it was not measured. \n",

    "Calibration runs were taken too, by shouting directly positive muons at a given energy on the target, e.g. they consist of single tracks on either of the two sides of the apparatus as shown in the following picture. Which side of the apparatus was determined by the sign of the current powering the magnet.\n",

    "Each detector consists of four layers of drift-tubes, i.e. cells with an anodic wire at the center and cathods at the sides filled up with a gas mixture of ${\\rm Ar-CO_2}$ ($85\\%-15\\%$). The passage of a charged particle through a cell would ionize the gas, with a consequent drift of electrons towards the anodic wire. Exploiting a linear relation (the drift velocity inside the cell is constant), by measuring the time of arrival of the primary ionization, it is possible to reconstruct the track's position within the cell. Note that there is a left-right ambiguity in the determination of the position (blue-red dots in the display).\n",

    "The following picture shows the hits left by the muons passing through one fo the detectors (the straight lines represent fits to the recorded hits, we will come to that later). The anodic wires (not drawn) sit at the center of the cells.\n",
